I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Aier Institute of Digital Ophthalmology & Visual Science, Aier Eye Hospital Group. My research focuses on developing reliable and efficient machine learning approaches for ophthalmology. Prior to this, I obtained my Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering from the School of Biomedical Engineering at <a href="https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/">Shanghai Jiao Tong University</a>.

# Research Interest #

Currently, I am deeply passionate about **large language model (LLM)** evaluation and **multimodal large language model (MLLM)** development and its application in ophthalmology. I have also devoted significant time to the generalization of deep learning models, especially in **out-of-distribution generalization** and **federated learning**. However, I no longer view generalization as a critical issue in real applications and have waned the enthusiasm in this field.
